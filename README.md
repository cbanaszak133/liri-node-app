#Liri Bot

##What it is
Liri is a node command line based application that takes in certain commands to output
Tweets, Spotify request, and movie searches. 

##How it Works
Liri was made using the Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB API's. For each I utilized NPM packages
in order to extract data from each API. I also utilized the Log4JS NPM package in order to
keep track of what is logged in the console within a log.txt file.
